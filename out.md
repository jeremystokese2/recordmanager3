# ABC Workflows

__Create new record__

What is a workflow?

_A workflow is a structured sequence of activities and tasks designed to achieve a specific outcome\, typically involving decision\-making processes_  _\._

__Prepare first draft __

__Send for approval__

Manual processes are converted into digital workflows\, streamlining operations and reducing errors\.

Workflows can be tailored to fit unique business needs\, whether by using templates or creating new processes from scratch\.

A detailed audit log provides visibility into every stage of the workflow\, from preparation to final decision\.

Activity timeline

![](img%5CABC%20Workflow%20builder0.png)

_The activity timeline is a visual representation of the workflow within the ABC solution's user interface\._

<span style="color:#000000">The timeline is </span>  <span style="color:#000000">divided into stages</span>  <span style="color:#000000">\, each containing specific tasks that need to be completed\. This structure helps in breaking down the workflow into manageable steps\.</span>

<span style="color:#000000">As tasks are completed\, the </span>  <span style="color:#000000">timeline updates </span>  <span style="color:#000000">to reflect the status\, providing real\-time insight into the workflow’s progress\.</span>

<span style="color:#000000">The timeline also highlights transitions between stages\, marking key decision points or approvals</span>  <span style="color:#000000">that move the workflow forward\.</span>

Roles and stage allocation

_Roles are assigned to specific stages\, determining responsibility for tasks within each phase\._

<span style="color:#000000">Tasks are assigned to pre\-defined roles</span>  <span style="color:#000000">\, such as Lead Author or Decision\-Maker\. </span>

<span style="color:#000000">Roles can be customised </span>  <span style="color:#000000">to meet the specific needs of your organisation\, allowing flexibility in task management\.</span>

<span style="color:#000000">Roles can be configured </span>  <span style="color:#000000">to accept many users </span>  <span style="color:#000000">\- like Collaborators\.</span>

<span style="color:#000000">Roles are </span>  <span style="color:#000000">directly linked to stages </span>  <span style="color:#000000">within the workflow\, ensuring that responsibilities shift appropriately as the process progresses\.</span>

<span style="color:#000000">Users can </span>  <span style="color:#000000">be assigned multiple roles </span>  <span style="color:#000000">across different stages\, allowing for dynamic participation in various aspects of the workflow\.</span>

<span style="color:#000000">Roles can be assigned during the creation of a record and can be modified or reassigned as needed throughout the workflow\.</span>

Task assignment

Assigning New Tasks to a Single RoleWhen a user completes a task\, they can assign the next task to a specific role\, maintaining control over who is responsible for each part of the process\.

Assigning New Tasks to Multiple Role OptionsAlternatively\, tasks can be assigned to one or several roles\, providing flexibility in who can take on the next step\.

Task types

Multiple Task TypesDifferent types of tasks can be defined within a workflow\, each representing a unique path that the workflow can follow\.

Role\-Specific Task DisplayWithin the same modal\, different sets of tasks can be shown depending on the role of the user\. This ensures that each role sees only the tasks relevant to their responsibilities\.

Task branching and paths

Creating Branches from the Happy PathWorkflows can be designed to branch out from the main\, or "happy\," path\. This allows for handling exceptions\, parallel processes\, or alternative scenarios within the same workflow\.

Selecting a PathUsers can have multiple actions available in the "I want to" dropdown\, allowing for flexible workflow paths\. Depending on the selected action\, tasks can transition to different states or stages\. This flexibility enables the workflow to adapt to various scenarios\, guiding the process down the appropriate path based on user decisions\.

Subtasks

A single task can be broken down into subtasks and assigned to multiple users\. For example\, a Lead Author might assign parts of a document to collaborators\. Subtasks are completed within the same workflow path\, without creating new branches\.

Decision and signature transitions

Transitions can be identified as decision points\, requiring a choice to be made\, or as points where signatures are needed\, either through traditional or digital methods\.
